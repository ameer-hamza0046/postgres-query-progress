# postgres-query-progress
PostgreSQL does not currently provide a way to track the progress of running queries, which can be frustrating for users and database administrators (DBAs). Long-running queries make users uncertain about whether to wait or abort them, leading to inefficiency and poor user experience. A query progress indicator would provide real-time updates on query execution. It will help users to make informed decisions and improving overall database management. Implementing this feature requires understanding PostgreSQLâ€™s internal query processing and finding accurate methods to estimate query progress.

We modified the following files:
1. /postgresql/src/include/executor/executor.h
2. /postgresql/src/include/nodes/execnodes.h
3. /postgresql/src/backend/executor/nodeSeqscan.c

We used the number of getNext() calls to estimate the total running time for each query to indicate the query progress.
